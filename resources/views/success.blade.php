                                              Nathalie described how she passed through more struggles of life with her family because of the poverty.  She was all alone who has been fighting to put food on a table because her husband was jobless and it was difficult for her to make it. Nathalie was a teacher in a primary school for 18 years. It was a private school from ADEPR and her own children used to study there since she started working in the school. 
                                              The school fees of her children were really a big problem though they used to cut from her salary for the sake of her children’s school fees and there was not enough money to satisfy all their needs.
                                              After 18 years of work in that primary school, she stopped the job and started looking of how she can make business and fulfill the needs of her family as well. 
                                              She was a member of one Group from the community, and took an initiative of taking loan from the group of 400,000 Rwf and bought pairs of Kitenge and started selling them. After sometimes she and her sister involved in a business of selling Maize flour for 1 million Rwandan francs from Uganda for credit, unfortunately; the car that brought them burned with fire and with all the bags of Maize flour that was inside. Nothing remained.
